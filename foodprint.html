							<p>This project aims to connect the dots between what we eat and the health of our planet unravelling a simple but overlooked fact: our diets have a profound impact on the environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								The staggering statistics are clear:¬†animal agriculture consumes 83% of farmland and is a leading cause of climate change.¬†Yet, many of us don‚Äôt associate this to the food in our plates.
							</p>
							<p>	
								Inspired by global initiatives and armed with data, I set out to transform insights into actionable information, aiming to make the environmental impact of our diets¬†visible¬†and empower everyone to make positive changes for a healthier Earth üí™üèº.

							<h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
							<div class="creation-content">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/design-process.png" alt="Design Process steps-discovery-define-ideate-create" /></span>
							</div>

							<p>The journey to create Food Print began as a deeply personal exploration.</p> 
							<p>After changing my diet four years ago, I immersed myself in understanding the ramifications of our modern food systems on the environment. I discovered that many people overlook the origin of the food on their plates‚Äîthe intricate journey it takes to reach us and the lives, both human and animal, involved along the way. This disconnect is largely due to human psychology; our minds often struggle to comprehend issues that aren‚Äôt immediately visible. The distant implications of climate change can slip from our awareness, making the need for education and awareness more pressing than ever. </p>
							<div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 2em;">
								<h3>Discovery</h3>
							</div>

							<h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
								
							<p>I surveyed 10 people for this project and their answers echoed the disconnect.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><i>"I care about the environment, but I don't know what more I can do besides recycling."</i></li></br>
										<li><i>"I know dietary choices matter, but I wish someone could tell me exactly what to eat."</i></li></br>
										<li><i>"Climate change is important, but I doubt my actions can make a difference."</i></li>
									</ul>

							<p>I went through many ideas that I refined while testing it on users.
							</p>

							<p>The first iterations of the app focused on presenting evidence and allowing users to interact 
								with data on how different diets affect the world. 
							</p>

							<p>However, it became clear that while education was crucial, it wasn't enough to drive sustained engagement. 
								The pivotal moment came with the realization that the app needed to tap into intrinsic human motivations.
							</p>

							<h4>Enter Gamification</h4>

							<p>Leveraging the Octalysis Framework, I reimagined the app to harness the 8 Core Drives of human motivation.</p>
							<p>From the epic meaning of saving the planet to the personal accomplishment of improving one's diet, each drive was carefully woven into the app's fabric to create a compelling and motivating experience.
							</p>
							<p><strong>1. Epic Meaning & Calling:</strong> My idea was to make users users feel like they are heroes on a mission to save the planet through their daily choices.
							</p>

							<p><strong>2. Development & Accomplishment:</strong> By displaying a score based on their food choices as well as cumulative metrics such as land spared, CO2 reduced, animals helped, and water saved, users can visually and numerically see their accomplishments, which fuels their motivation to continue making positive changes.
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback:</strong> Personalized diet profiles and actionable recommendations for improvement. AI chat feature, "Ask Seed," further enhances this drive by providing personalized assistance and responding to user queries, making the experience interactive and dynamic.</p>

							<p><strong>4. Ownership & Possession:</strong> Users can track their dietary habits and their environmental impact. This sense of ownership is strengthened through the detailed diet profiles and cumulative achievements. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>5. Social Influence & Relatedness:</strong> The app encourages community engagement through collective challenges such as Veganuary.
							</p>

							<p><strong>6. Scarcity & Impatience:</strong> "Food Print" leverages the drive of scarcity by introducing limited-time community challenges and seasonal events. This drive keeps the app dynamic and engaging, encouraging users to return regularly.
							</p>

							<p><strong>7. Unpredictability & Curiosity:</strong> The app keeps users curious and engaged by continually offering new articles and resources in the Explore tab. The AI chat, "Ask Seed," adds an element of unpredictability by providing personalized and varied responses to user queries. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>8. Loss & Avoidance:</strong> The visual representation of the world on a low scores taps into the drive of loss and avoidance. This drive encourages users to maintain their good habits and strive for continuous improvement to avoid losing their progress.

								<h2>Take-away</h2>
								<p>
									This project allowed me to dive deep into mobile app development, exploring this platform‚Äôs unique capabilities. It was both fun and rewarding not only because I got to 
									focus on a cause I deeply care about but also allowed me to learn more about the affordances of mobile design.
								</p>
								<p>
								Creating something meaningful that bridges convenience and sustainability felt like a great opportunity for me as a designer. To design solutions that not only simplify users' lives but also encourage positive social impact is one of the reasons I love what I do.	
								</p>
								<p>
									At the moment, I‚Äôm working on this project‚Äôs prototype, so stay tuned üòé.
