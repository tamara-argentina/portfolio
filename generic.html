							<p>Ever wondered how your diet could be a superpower for the planet?
							</p>
							
							<p>Our planet needs help, but we as individuals see ourselves as helpless when it comes to making a 
								difference especially thinking that something so mundane as our eating habits could matter.
							</p>
							<p>
								Yet, when it comes to climate change, our actions in the kitchen could be our flying cape (picture a cool 
								superhero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).
							</p>
							<p>	
								Research shows that adopting plant-based diets can dramatically reduce the land needed for agriculture, by 
								as much as 74%. Considering that animal agriculture currently consumes 83%
								(yes, 83!) of the land used for farming and that deforestation is one of the main causes of climate change - 
								we can confidently say that our food choices do matter.
							</p>
							<p>	
								This project is designed to connect the dots between what we eat and the health of our planet. It's about making 
								the impacts of our food choices visible and empowering individuals to make positive changes.

								<h3>Discovery</h3>
							</div>
							

							<p>Inspired by global initiatives like the Plant-based Treaty, Plate Up for the Planet, and Planet-Based Diets from Panda.com, and armed with data from Our
								 World in Data, I embarked on a mission to transform insights into actionable information. 
							</p>
							<p>	 
								 The goal? To steer powerful habit changes that benefit both our 
								 health and the planet.
							</p>
							<p>Human psychology presents a challenge: our brains struggle to grasp what's not immediately visible and climate change, with its vast and distant 
								implications, often falls out of our minds. </p>

							<h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
								
							<p>Interviews for this project echoed this disconnect:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><i>"I care about the environment, but I don't know what more I can do besides recycling."</i></li></br>
										<li><i>"I know dietary choices matter, but I wish someone could tell me exactly what to eat."</i></li></br>
										<li><i>"Climate change is important, but I doubt my actions can make a difference."</i></li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Ideation</h3>
							</div>

							<p>I went through many ideas that I refined while testing it on users.
							</p>

							<p>The first wireframes were a mere showcase of evidence that the user could play and interact with to see how different diets affect the world.
							</p>

							<div>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/first wireframes.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>

							<p>lt was very straightforward but lacking user motivation...why would my users even want to come 
								to my application or once they did, stay on it? ... it was not going to work.
							</p>

							<h4>Refining with Purpose: The Octalysis Framework</h4>

							<p>I based this part of my project on the Core Drives of the Octalysis Framework from Actionable Gamification by Yu-Kai Chou.
							</p>

							<p>
								We as human beings need motivation to do... well, almost anything. So I aimed to create an engaging and motivating user 
								experience by leveraging the 8 Core Drives of Actionable Gamification. Each core drive plays a crucial role in ensuring 
								that users are not only drawn to the app but also find value and motivation in their journey towards better nutrition and sustainability. 
							</p>
							<p><strong>1. Epic Meaning & Calling:</strong> My idea was to make users users feel like they are heroes on a mission to save the planet through their daily choices.
							</p>

							<p><strong>2. Development & Accomplishment:</strong> By displaying a score based on their food choices as well as cumulative metrics such as land spared, CO2 reduced, animals helped, and water saved, users can visually and numerically see their accomplishments, which fuels their motivation to continue making positive changes.
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback:</strong> Personalized diet profiles and actionable recommendations for improvement. AI chat feature, "Ask Seed," further enhances this drive by providing personalized assistance and responding to user queries, making the experience interactive and dynamic.</p>

							<p><strong>4. Ownership & Possession:</strong> Users can track their dietary habits and their environmental impact. This sense of ownership is strengthened through the detailed diet profiles and cumulative achievements. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>5. Social Influence & Relatedness:</strong> The app encourages community engagement through collective challenges such as Veganuary.
							</p>

							<p><strong>6. Scarcity & Impatience:</strong> "Food Print" leverages the drive of scarcity by introducing limited-time community challenges and seasonal events. This drive keeps the app dynamic and engaging, encouraging users to return regularly.
							</p>

							<p><strong>7. Unpredictability & Curiosity:</strong> The app keeps users curious and engaged by continually offering new articles and resources in the Explore tab. The AI chat, "Ask Seed," adds an element of unpredictability by providing personalized and varied responses to user queries. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>8. Loss & Avoidance:</strong> The visual representation of the world on a low scores taps into the drive of loss and avoidance. This drive encourages users to maintain their good habits and strive for continuous improvement to avoid losing their progress.


							<h4>User Flow</h4>	

							<div style="padding: 0 2em;">
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/user flow.png" alt="" /></span>

							<h4>Typography, colors, logo creations</h4>	

							<div style="margin: 0;">
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/typography.png" alt="" /></span>
							</div>

							<p><strong>Color Scheme</strong></p>
							<p>
								In designing the "Food Print" app, I opted for a purple color scheme. This choice was driven by the need 
								to create a visually appealing and cohesive user experience that accommodates the app's scale system, which ranges from red (indicating poor performance) to green (indicating optimal performance). Purple served as a neutral and harmonious color that would not conflict with the red-to-green gradient used to indicate different states within the app.
								Purple is often associated with creativity, wisdom, and calmness, which aligns well with the app's goals 
								of promoting mindful eating and sustainable practices. Furthermore, purple provides a sense of elegance and 
								sophistication, making the app visually appealing and inviting to users.
							</p>

							<p><strong>Logo Design</strong></p>
							<p>
								The logo for "Food Print" was crafted to symbolize the core values and mission of this project. The logo features a print in the form of a carrot, combining two essential elements:</br>
								1. Carrot Shape: The carrot represents healthy eating and nutrition, which are central to the app's purpose. Carrots are commonly associated with health and wellness, making them a fitting symbol for an app focused on promoting healthy dietary habits.</br>
								2. Print Design: The print element within the carrot shape signifies the impact or "footprint" that users' dietary choices have on their health and the environment. This concept ties back to the app's name, "Food Print," emphasizing the importance of mindful eating and sustainability.
