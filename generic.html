							<p><strong>Ever wondered if your daily choices could be the secret weapon in our fight for a healthier planet?  </strong> 
							</p>
							
							<p>At the heart of this project lies a simple yet powerful truth: our diets have a profound impact on the environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Inspired by global initiatives and armed with data, I set out on a mission to transform insights into actionable information, aiming to steer powerful habit changes that benefit both our health and the planet.
							</p>
							<p>	
								The staggering statistics are clear: animal agriculture consumes 83% of farmland and is a 
								leading cause of climate change. Yet, many of us feel disconnected from the impact of our 
								dietary choices.
							</p>
							<p>	
								This project aims to connect the dots between what we eat and the health of our planet. 
								It's about making the environmental impact of our diets visible and empowering everyone 
								to make positive changes for a healthier Earth.

							<div class="creation-content">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/design-process.png" alt="Design Process steps-discovery-define-ideate-create" /></span>
							</div>

							<p>The journey of creating the "Food Print" app was both challenging and rewarding. </p>
							<p>It began with a deep dive into research and evolved through ideation, user flow design, and the creation of 
								high-fidelity prototypes. Each step was guided by a commitment to empower users with knowledge and motivation to make positive changes.</p>

							<div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 2em;">
								<h3>Discovery</h3>
							</div>
		
							<p>Human psychology presents a challenge: our brains struggle to grasp what's not immediately visible and climate change, with its vast and distant 
								implications, often falls out of our minds. </p>

							<h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
								
							<p>Interviews for this project echoed this disconnect:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><i>"I care about the environment, but I don't know what more I can do besides recycling."</i></li></br>
										<li><i>"I know dietary choices matter, but I wish someone could tell me exactly what to eat."</i></li></br>
										<li><i>"Climate change is important, but I doubt my actions can make a difference."</i></li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Ideation</h3>
							</div>

							<p>I went through many ideas that I refined while testing it on users.
							</p>

							<p>The first iterations of the app focused on presenting evidence and allowing users to interact 
								with data on how different diets affect the world. 
							</p>

							<div>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/first wireframes.png" alt="first wireframes" /></span>
							</div>

							<p>However, it became clear that while education was crucial, it wasn't enough to drive sustained engagement. 
								The pivotal moment came with the realization that the app needed to tap into intrinsic human motivations.
							</p>

							<h4>Enter Gamification</h4>

							<p>Leveraging the Octalysis Framework, I reimagined the app to harness the 8 Core Drives of human motivation.</p>
							<p>From the epic meaning of saving the planet to the personal accomplishment of improving one's diet, each drive was carefully woven into the app's fabric to create a compelling and motivating experience.
							</p>
							<p><strong>1. Epic Meaning & Calling:</strong> My idea was to make users users feel like they are heroes on a mission to save the planet through their daily choices.
							</p>

							<p><strong>2. Development & Accomplishment:</strong> By displaying a score based on their food choices as well as cumulative metrics such as land spared, CO2 reduced, animals helped, and water saved, users can visually and numerically see their accomplishments, which fuels their motivation to continue making positive changes.
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>3. Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback:</strong> Personalized diet profiles and actionable recommendations for improvement. AI chat feature, "Ask Seed," further enhances this drive by providing personalized assistance and responding to user queries, making the experience interactive and dynamic.</p>

							<p><strong>4. Ownership & Possession:</strong> Users can track their dietary habits and their environmental impact. This sense of ownership is strengthened through the detailed diet profiles and cumulative achievements. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>5. Social Influence & Relatedness:</strong> The app encourages community engagement through collective challenges such as Veganuary.
							</p>

							<p><strong>6. Scarcity & Impatience:</strong> "Food Print" leverages the drive of scarcity by introducing limited-time community challenges and seasonal events. This drive keeps the app dynamic and engaging, encouraging users to return regularly.
							</p>

							<p><strong>7. Unpredictability & Curiosity:</strong> The app keeps users curious and engaged by continually offering new articles and resources in the Explore tab. The AI chat, "Ask Seed," adds an element of unpredictability by providing personalized and varied responses to user queries. 
							</p>

							<p><strong>8. Loss & Avoidance:</strong> The visual representation of the world on a low scores taps into the drive of loss and avoidance. This drive encourages users to maintain their good habits and strive for continuous improvement to avoid losing their progress.


							<h4>User Flow</h4>

							<h4>Style Guide</h4>	

							<div class="styleguide-content">
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Style guide.png" alt="style guide" /></span>
							</div>

							<p><strong>Color Scheme</strong></p>
							<p> Choosing the right color palette was essential. Purple emerged as the perfect neutral, harmonizing with the app's red-to-green scale system that indicates different states of environmental impact.
							</p>
								
							<p> 🟪 This color often associated with creativity and wisdom, set the tone for a user experience that is both engaging and enlightening.

								incorporating feedback from potential users and peers to refine the design.
