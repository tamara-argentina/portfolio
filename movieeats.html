				<p>This was my first assignment for the Google UX Design certificate I've recently finished.
					I had to pick a prompt with an idea for an app and I chose to design an app to order snacks at a
					cinema: <em>'Movie Eats'</em>.</p>
					<p>This app was designed to be used on mobile devices as it is the way people would normally order
					food while at the cinema.

				<h3>Houston, we have a problem</h3>
				<p>Many cinemas do not offer a digital way of ordering snacks and the ones that do, lack variety in food
					or lists of ingredients making the whole experience a little frustrating for
					customers.
				</p>
				<p>It is estimated that 40% of moviegoers buy concessions every time they visit a cinema, this
					makes snacks a big part of the business’ profits so making the whole snack experience just an afterthought translates into a lost opportunity for cinemas to make an additional profit.

				<h3>The Plot</h3>

				<!-- <h5>User Research</h5>
				<p>For this project, I took a qualitative approach focused on goals.</br>
					I started by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type: circle;"> Understanding the processes and emotions that users would experience when using my
						product.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: circle;">Identifying common behaviours and experiences with the tasks my product is trying to
						address.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: circle;">Understanding the needs and frustrations of users around these type of products.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>Tools:</em> Surveys, identifying pain points, personas hypothesis, competitive analysis.</p>

							enjoys taking them out for recreation, I want to be able to easily browse food options on

				<h5>Problem Statement</h5>
				<p>
					'Norma is an active senior citizen who needs an easy app that won't make her feel alienated from technology so she can enjoy the snack side of the cinema experience 
					all while making sure she can browse proper food categories suitable for her and her grandchildren's different dietary needs.'
				</p>
				<!-- <p>'Isabel is a busy professional, vegan since 2020, who needs an app to easily scan for stores, bars, etc with vegan 
								options around her because she always ends up getting the same stuff due to lack of time to do 
								some research.'
							</p> 	 -->
				<h5>Competitive Audit</h5>
				<p>I audited 2 direct and 1 indirect competitors:<em> Showcase cinemas, Hoyts cinemas, and Candy
						Cloud.</em></p>
				<p>My direct competitors are well-known cinemas worldwide with branches in Argentina and the indirect is
					a snack store.</br>
					One of the cinemas, Showcase cinemas, has snacks arranged by categories but they don't provide any
					information regarding the type of food or ingredients, whereas Hoyts cinemas do not have many options
					available (in Argentina). </p>
				<p>The visual design of both is slick and modern, but in the case of Showcase cinemas, the number of
					different types of options available like dine-in, take-away, added benefits for an extra fee, etc
					makes it a little too busy for the eye. </p>
				<p>There are also some accessibility issues like small font or the use of foreign words, like
					<i>'candy'</i>, in a country where English is not mainstream that could frustrate or exclude users
					who don't know the meaning of such word from the whole experience altogether.

				<h6>Impact</h6>
				<blockquote>‘I found this app really easy to use and I really like 
					the fact that I can filter my food and find vegan 
					options even at the cinema, a sign that the world 
					is evolving’.</blockquote>
					<p style="text-align: right;">Betiana, participant number 5.</p>
					<h6>What I've learned</h6>
				<p>This was my first project and my introduction to the whole design thinking based on the user approach. 
					I learned that getting people's views and keeping the user's goals along the entire process is really eye-opening but it also helpful since it works as a guide
					and the result you come up at the end would not only be beautiful but usable and useful which is what constitutes good design.
