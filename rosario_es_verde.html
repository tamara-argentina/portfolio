								<h3>The Problem</h3>
							<p>The vegan community and way of life is growing rapidly and with that the amount of places that offer options suitable for vegans.</br> 
								However, it’s still evolving and it’s hard to find all the places offering products suitable for this community</p>
								<h3>The Goal</h3>
							<p>‘Rosario is verde’ is meant to help the people of such city to have a complete and detailed map 
								of the vegan friendly places in their city as well as helping put small local businesses ‘literally’ 
								and metaphorically on the map.</p>

								<h4>Understanding the user</h4>

								<h5>User Research</h5>
								<p>I conducted a survey on a vegan community online. </br>I received a lot of useful feedback which mainly stated 
									that the participants either not know if there are vegan maps out there or that the ones that exist are not good 
									enough.
									Most of them rely on Instagram to find out about places but the problem with Instagram is that unless 
									you remember the name of that place you are looking for you can’t really find it.</br>
									Most of the participants stated they would use an app that allow them to filter easily, which was 
									their main struggle</p>

								<h5>Personas</h5>

								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<span class="image fit">
											<img src="images/verde/Persona(Isabel).jpg" alt="" />
										</span>
										<h6>User Story</h6>
										<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; color: #424242;">'As a busy professional I want a way to quickly scan for vegan places and vegan options around me so I don't end up getting the same things from the same places all the time.'
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
										<span class="image fit">
											<img src="images/verde/Persona(Juan).jpg" alt="" />
										</span>
										<h6>User Story</h6>
										<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; color: #424242;">'As an entrepreneur and small business owner, I'd love to have a way to reach the vegan community of my city so as to grow my clientele while making a good impact.'
										</p>

							<h5>Problem Statements</h5>
							<p>
								'Juan has recently open a vegan bakery in his hometown of Rosario and needs a way to easily reach the vegan community and spread 
                                the word of his vegan 
                                local business.'
							</p>
							<p>'Isabel is a busy professional, vegan since 2020, who needs an app to easily scan for stores, bars, etc with vegan 
								options around her because she always ends up getting the same stuff due to lack of time to do 
								some research.'
							</p> 	
					
							<h5>Competitive Audit</h5>
                            <p>I audited 2 direct and 2 indirect competitors.</br> They study revealed some good features that I 
                                implemented on my design like the ability for users to upload their photos, a link to each place's menu, etc.</br>
                                It also allow me to see how the filters work and realized that the use of too many colors in a small layout as 
                                that of a cell phone can be a little overwhelming</p>

                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/verde/competitive audit.jpg" alt="competitive audit" /></span>
						
							<h4>Starting the design</h4>
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">
									<h5>Wireframes</h5>
										<p>After ideating in paper with exercises like Crazy 8s, I came out with a few ideas for my first wireframes.</p>
										<p>The idea was to find a way to make information accessible since the get go to allow the user to interact with a map and stores categories right 
											from the start, all with a clean style</p>
										<p>On the left they would see the type of stores listed with a corresponding icon to easily identify them on the mapand then they can sort 
											those according to dietary needs into vegan, vegetarian, and places with those options in their menus.</p>

							<h5 style="text-align: center;">Usability Study</h5>

							<h6>Findings</h6>
							<div class="row gtr-uniform">
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<li>6 out of 6 participants found they needed feedback from the system regarding whether their actions had been noted.</br>
										The UI needs to give clues about where in the app the user is.
									</li>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<li>2 out of 6 participants found it frustrating having to scroll all the way up on the store page to hit like. </br>
										Users need a faster way to save places.</li>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<li>1 out of 5 participants found they wanted to hit save on a store they already knew before going to the individual page. </br>

									<h5>Usability Study Impact</h5>
									<ul>
									<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Added the possibility to add a store to favorites from the store-cards view.</li>
									<li style="list-style-type: disc;">The score stars where changed to a number to maximize space on the card.</li>
									<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Dietary needs filters were reduced to one line only</li>
									<li style="list-style-type: disc;">When selecting a dietary need, I added the wording into the UI to let the user know exactly what his selection is and not rely solely on the change of color of the button on top.</li>
									<li style="list-style-type: disc;">The heart on the store page was then set to fix so the user can store it without going all the way up.</li>

							<h4>Responsive Design</h4>
							<p>After creating the dedicated mobile experience, I started the whole design thinking process again to consider different use cases.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/verde/web-frame.png" alt="Desktop" /></span>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>What are my users' motivations and goals?</li>
								<li>How can the companion website support the dedicated mobile app?</li>
								<li></li>
							</ul>
							<p>As this app is meant to be a map to use on the go on a mobile, the desktop version could complement it with added features to make it into a different experience without loosing the consistency or coherence of its mobile version.</p>

							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-8 col-12-medium"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/verde/restos-frame.png" alt="Restaurants Desktop version" /></span></div>
									<div style="margin: 2em 0 0 0;" class="col-4 col-12-medium">
										<p style="text-align: center;">Some of the adissions include:</p>
										<ul>
										<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Landpage with card of the best rated places in Rosario.</li>
										<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Option to explore the map.</li>
										<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Information about veganism and different related articles including how to reduce our impact on global warming.</li>
										<li style="list-style-type: disc;">A way to interact with other members of the same community.</li>
										<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Access to online stores that support the same values.</li>

							<h4>Takeaways</h4>
							<p>This project was challenging since it involved making a lot of information available in the clearest and fastest possible way without making it too crowded.</br>
							With every project I learn the importance of having a system to follow but allowing for flexibility at the same time as one needs to be constantly iterating on each phase.</p>
							<p>This design was meant for a social good and it is a topic that I feel close to my heart so I really enjoyed it and learned a lot along the way.</p>
